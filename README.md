# Conceptoscape
Internship made in Sapienza. This is about a visualization of owl files converted in Graphol style.
It's focused on visualization of a single element (Concept, Role or Attribute).


# HOW TO USE
First you have to generate a json file from owl one. So, use GenerateJson.java code on your MAVEN project (Needs OWLAPI and simple-JSon libs) to generate a json file and use the POX.XML file for the dependencies. if you want to use an example, download the prova.json file.
Once you have the json file, run index.html and follow the 3 steps: upload the json generated file, choose the type and the entity you want, then draw it!
[Here](https://1655653.github.io/)'s a web demo. use the prova.json file!
