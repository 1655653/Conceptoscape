# Conceptoscape
Internship made in Sapienza. This is about a visualization of owl files converted in Graphol style.
It's focused on visualization of a single element (Concept, Role or Attribute).


# HOW TO USE
First you have to generate a json file from owl one. So, use GenerateJson.java code on your MAVEN project (Needs OWLAPI and simple-JSon libs) to generate a json file and use the POX.XML file for the dependencies.
Once you have the json file, run index.html and follow the 3 steps: upload the json generated file, choose the type and the entity you want, then draw it!
[Here](https://1655653.github.io/) a web demo. use the prova.json file!
