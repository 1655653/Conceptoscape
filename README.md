Internship made in Sapienza. This is about a visualization of owl files converted in Graphol style.
It's focused on visualization of a single element (Concept, Role or Attribute).

# How to use
First you have to generate a json file from owl one. So, use GenerateJson.java code on your poject (Needs OWLAPI and simple-JSon libs) to generate a json file. If you want just use the web part with a json demo file, use prova.json.
Once you have the json file, run index.html and follow the 3 steps: upload the json generated file, choose the type and the entity you want, then draw it!
