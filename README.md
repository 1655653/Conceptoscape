# Conceptoscape
Internship made in Sapienza. This is about a visualization of owl files converted in Graphol style.
It's focused on visualization of a single element (Concept, Role or Attribute).
If you want to contact me please write at longo.1655653@studenti.uniroma1.it.

# HOW TO USE
## JAVA PHASE
First you have to generate a json file from an owl one. To do this, use GenerateJson.java in Javaphase folder on your MAVEN project (Needs OWLAPI and simple-JSon libs). Use the POX.XML file for the dependencies. If you want to use an example, simply download the prova.json file.
## JAVASCRIPT
Once you have the json file, run index.html and follow the 3 steps: upload the json generated file, choose the type and the entity you want, then draw it and enjoy!
[Here](https://1655653.github.io/Conceptoscape/)'s a web demo with pre-loaded the the prova.json file! just choose type and the entity. Enjoy!
